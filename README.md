# README.md: Containerization and Docker Guide

This guide provides an introduction to containerization and Docker, covering Docker basics, tools, creating and managing images, and managing containers. It includes practical examples and commands to help you get started with Docker effectively.

## 4. Introduction to Containerization and Docker

### What is Containerization?

Containerization is a lightweight virtualization technology that allows applications and their dependencies to run in isolated environments called **containers**. Unlike virtual machines (VMs), which require a full guest operating system, containers share the host system's kernel, packaging only the application, runtime, libraries, and configurations. This makes containers faster, more resource-efficient, and highly portable.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Portability**: Run consistently across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Isolation**: Prevent conflicts between applications by isolating their environments.
- **Efficiency**: Use fewer resources than VMs by sharing the host OS.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications up or down.

### What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the creation, deployment, and management of containers. It simplifies packaging applications with their dependencies into portable containers, enabling consistent execution across different systems. Docker is widely adopted due to its ease of use, robust ecosystem, and extensive community support.

### Docker Basics

#### Core Concepts

- **Containers**: Runnable instances of Docker images that encapsulate an application and its dependencies. Containers are isolated but can communicate via networks or shared volumes.
- **Images**: Read-only templates containing application code, runtime, libraries, and settings. Images are built from a `Dockerfile` and stored in registries like Docker Hub.
- **Dockerfile**: A script with instructions to build a Docker image (e.g., specifying a base image, copying files, running commands).
- **Docker Daemon**: A background service (`dockerd`) that manages Docker objects (images, containers, networks, volumes) and handles API requests.
- **Docker Client**: A command-line tool (`docker`) for interacting with the Docker daemon via commands like `docker run` or `docker build`.
- **Docker Registry**: A repository for storing and sharing Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).

#### Docker Architecture

Docker uses a client-server model:
- The **Docker Client** sends commands to the **Docker Daemon**.
- The **Docker Daemon** builds, runs, and manages containers.
- **Docker Registries** store images for distribution.

Simplified architecture diagram:

```
+-------------+           +-----------------+           +-----------------+
| Docker CLI  | <-------> | Docker Daemon   | <-------> | Docker Registry |
+-------------+           +-----------------+           +-----------------+
                                |
                                v
                         +-------------+
                         | Containers  |
                         +-------------+
```

### Docker Tools

#### Docker CLI

The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary tool for managing Docker resources. It offers commands to handle images, containers, networks, and more.

**Basic Commands:**
- `docker --version`: Check the installed Docker version.
- `docker info`: Display system-wide Docker information.
- `docker pull <image>`: Download an image from a registry.
- `docker run <image>`: Launch a container from an image.
- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker ps -a`: List all containers (running and stopped).
- `docker stop <container>`: Stop a running container.
- `docker rm <container>`: Remove a stopped container.
- `docker images`: List downloaded images.
- `docker rmi <image>`: Delete an image.

**Example: Running a Container**
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
This pulls the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub and runs a container that outputs a confirmation message.

#### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications using a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`). It simplifies running complex applications with multiple services.

**Key Commands:**
- `docker-compose up`: Start all services defined in the YAML file.
- `docker-compose down`: Stop and remove all services.
- `docker-compose build`: Build or rebuild services.
- `docker-compose logs`: View logs from all services.

**Example: `docker-compose.yml` for a Web App**
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  app:
    image: node:14
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
    command: node server.js
```
Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
This launches an NGINX web server and a Node.js app, mapping port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the `web` container.

## 5. Creating and Managing Docker Images

### Building Docker Images

#### Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` defines the steps to create a Docker image. Each instruction (e.g., `FROM`, `COPY`, `RUN`) adds a layer to the image.

**Common Instructions:**
- `FROM`: Sets the base image.
- `COPY`: Copies files from the host to the image.
- `RUN`: Executes commands during the build process.
- `CMD`: Specifies the default command for the container.
- `EXPOSE`: Indicates the ports the container listens on.
- `ENV`: Sets environment variables.

**Example: Dockerfile for a Python App**
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the app port
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Build the Image**
```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .
```
- `-t my-python-app`: Tags the image as `my-python-app`.
- `.`: Uses the current directory as the build context.

#### Best Practices
- **Minimize Layers**: Combine commands (e.g., `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y`) to reduce layers.
- **Use Lightweight Images**: Prefer `slim` or `alpine` base images to reduce size.
- **Leverage Caching**: Place stable commands (e.g., dependency installation) early in the `Dockerfile`.
- **Exclude Unnecessary Files**: Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, etc.

---

### Managing Docker Images

#### Tagging Images

Tags identify specific versions of an image. The default tag is `latest`, but custom tags are recommended.

**Example:**
```bash
docker build -t my-python-app:v1 .
```

#### Pushing Images to a Registry

Share images by uploading them to a registry like Docker Hub.

1. **Log in to Docker Hub:**
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```
2. **Tag the Image:**
   ```bash
   docker tag my-python-app:v1 username/my-python-app:v1
   ```
3. **Push the Image:**
   ```bash
   docker push username/my-python-app:v1
   ```

#### Pulling Images from a Registry

Download images using:
```bash
docker pull username/my-python-app:v1
```

---

## 6. Managing Docker Containers

### Running, Stopping, and Removing Containers

#### Running a Container
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my-app my-python-app
```
- `-d`: Runs in detached mode.
- `-p 5000:5000`: Maps host port 5000 to container port 5000.
- `--name my-app`: Names the container `my-app`.

#### Stopping a Container
```bash
docker stop my-app
```

#### Removing a Container
```bash
docker rm my-app
```
For a running container, force removal with:
```bash
docker rm -f my-app
```

---

### Inspecting and Logging Containers

#### Inspecting a Container
```bash
docker inspect my-app
```
This outputs detailed metadata (e.g., IP address, mounts, configuration) in JSON format.

#### Viewing Logs
```bash
docker logs my-app
```
Follow logs in real-time:
```bash
docker logs -f my-app
```

---

### Managing Container Volumes and Networks

#### Volumes

Volumes persist data beyond a container’s lifecycle and can be shared between containers.

- **Create a Volume:**
  ```bash
  docker volume create my-data
  ```
- **Run a Container with a Volume:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d -v my-data:/app/data --name my-app my-python-app
  ```
  This mounts `my-data` to `/app/data` in the container.

#### Networks

Networks enable communication between containers.

- **Create a Network:**
  ```bash
  docker network create my-net
  ```
- **Run Containers on the Network:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d --network my-net --name app1 my-python-app
  docker run -d --network my-net --name app2 my-python-app
  ```
  Containers `app1` and `app2` can communicate using their names.
